# 🚲 The Bike Shop – Power BI Dashboard

A comprehensive end-to-end data analysis project using **SQL** and **Power BI** to uncover insights for a bike rental business. This report explores **sales trends**, **profitability**, **rider demographics**, and **pricing strategy**, with actionable business recommendations based on real-time metrics.

## ⚙️ Project Flow

- Created a consolidated **SQL database** by combining data from two separate yearly tables using a Common Table Expression       (CTE).
- Joined sales data with cost tables to calculate key metrics like **Revenue** and **Profit** using SQL logic.
- Built a custom **Power Query** that was written in SQL, then integrated into Power BI via direct connection to a SQL Server.
- Performed data transformations and calculated fields using **DAX** for advanced KPIs and trend analysis.

## 📊 Key Features

- **Interactive Power BI Dashboard** with KPIs for Revenue, Profit, Riders, and Profit Margin.
- Data exploration by:
  - Hour and day (to identify peak performance times)
  - Month and season (to support planning and forecasting)
  - Rider type (registered vs casual)
- Integrated slicers and visuals for dynamic data exploration.
- Embedded **strategic business recommendations** driven by data insights.

## 🧠 Insights Uncovered

- Midday hours (10 AM – 3 PM) and mid-week (Wednesday and Friday) are the most profitable timeframes.
- Summer months and Season 3 consistently generate the highest revenue.
- Registered riders make up the core customer base, offering opportunities for loyalty-driven strategies.
- Pricing elasticity exists — potential to test a 10–15% increase without major churn risk.
